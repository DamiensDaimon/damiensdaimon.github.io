title: Looking for Human Work
---

Careers are important, that much is obvious. I'm a recent high school graduate; the choice is stretched out before me, but the educational institutions I grew up in have given me basically no direction. That's alright - I'm happy to make the decision myself.

That's what I want to talk about - not picking one at random, because it sounds good or sounds good to your mum. Being able to make confident choices when the situation seems increasingly unclear.

<br>

None of my friends understand how building a career works. My parents don't. Actually, it looks to me like almost *nobody* has a real, tested model of how to make decisions about this kind of thing. Even successful people often seem to have stumbled into their role, or not be aware how lucky they got.

Doing creative work is really risky. This is what you'll be told if you consider being a painter rather than a marketing manager. I can't say I know that's wrong; but why is work treated as something unreliable, scary and burdensome? Conflicting opinions abound on this and just about every other thing a young person might want to know about their career options.

Put simply, I don't accept the common model of work and careers, because I find menial labour dehumanizing. Common views on work tend to pressure us into choosing roles without giving the critical thinking tools or information to escape what is often a false dichotomy. Equally bad are the entrepreneur gurus, who flood discussion with criticism of the university -> job model but peddle a false aspirational ideal that's equally rooted in a shortsighted view of work. 

So it's time, as is often best when conventional wisdom doesn't cut it, to figure it out for myself.

<br>

I'll probably explore this topic in depth, but for now let me lay down my guiding principle. My ethos is that you should spend your time doing valuable things. That's all. It's very simple, but it gets lost in the noise. And I mean intrinsically valuable things, not things that your mum or your bank value. This definition's a little fuzzy, sure, but it's infinitely preferable to a view that makes you a tool of other people. The point of my view is to shift the focus away from collective value, to lend backbone to an endeavour to live by personal value. 

Many people hold a sentiment to the effect of wanting to 'pursue their passion', without being able to commit to it. People just don't seem to be able to reconcile this. Perhaps this is because their goals are framed as something they want to be, not something they want to do. Decisions are made about what kind of worker they will be - not what kind of thing they will spend their time doing.

The common view of work leads to a totally artless world. I think it's responsible for a lot of the meaninglessness people feel. This is a romantic notion, and it might be construed as the more unrealistic one that everyone should be a scientist or artist.

*Trust thyself*. Focus on doing good work; monetary recompense will likely come later, and even if it doesn't you will have the knowledge that you spent your time doing something real. I guess it might be a matter of how of an idealist you are, whether you're willing to take the risk.

But we *do* need people to take the risk. The established institutions, the established pathways, can only do so much to better you and the world. The establishment has blindspots; people who can identify what work needs to be done on their own are needed to help solve problems existing jobs can't.

If you have any feeling at all that the world has problems to solve, you should understand becoming another cog in the machine does little to help. If you have any feeling at all the you have aspirations not fulfilled by your proscribed place, you should consider what it is you really want out of your work.

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with working a 'basic' job, but you should never sacrifice your capacity as a thinking being.

<br>

I guess it remains to be seen how this view pans out for me; maybe, my posts a few years down the line will show how I'm doing.

How does this apply, for example, to me? A few things. Wealth has little intrinsic value to me. Freedom does, which means I need enough wealth to maintain it. My natural dispositions mean that I enjoy work which involves learning and combining different skillsets, working with complex and insoluble abstract problems, picking out broad principles and mediating between different perspectives.

This might seem pretty useless. Truth be told, I am still pretty confused about what exactly would be the best kind of work for me. But I know I like thinking and communicating. So the question for me isn't, 'What job can I get where I can do thinking work?' The question is, 'How is good thinking work done? What do I need to do it?'.

It shifts the focus from *responding* to the market, to *anticipating* the market. Responding to the needs that drive the market.

This doesn't give a definitive answer on it's own. Now I have to figure out what good thinking work is. I look at what problems exist in the world - that takes research in itself. I look at the tools, individuals and institutions that have done the most work doing good thinking. I look at the skillsets involved. I look at my personal aptitudes.

The answer isn't always clear. As I said, I don't exactly know what I'm doing. And part of the problem of finding out where the real work is, is the obfuscation and impenetrability of information. A broad, accurate view of where society is going and what it needs is, as it turns out, pretty fucking difficult. And honestly, most high school grads don't even have the basic starting point of knowing themselves. So part of the answer is necessarily unknown, or must be found out by trial and error - by talking to people and trying different things. But it's a starting point.

For me, that starting point is 'I want to become a strong, critical but adventurous thinker, and I want to channel it and my aptitude for broad learning into work that does real, tangible good.'

For me, I don't know exactly know what form the work I end up doing will be. But I'm beginning to try different things, and I'm setting myself up by developing skills I know will be important. I plan to make a focused practice of the craft of writing and communication, because writing is valuable (and vital) no matter what kind of thinking work you're doing.

It's not an instant answer; it's a guiding star. And it's best with an understanding that the individual view of the world, the ability to make decisions for yourself about what's important is vital to life.

I'll probably write more on this; I'll probably revise this post later too, which for the moment is looking pretty rambley and thrown-together. Next time I want to start thinking more concretely about what work is good - what kind of work the world needs and that we can give - and how to do it. How to do better work. Alright, thanks for reading - hope it was helpful :)

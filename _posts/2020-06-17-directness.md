title: Ultralearning: Directness
---
I just finished Scott H. Young's 'Ultralearning'. I want to share one of his principles of 'Ultralearning' (Ultralearning is his name for a kind of aggressive, self-directed skill acquisition).

Directness.

Directness means engaging directly in the activity you are trying to improve on. It means focusing on the end goal of that activity. If you are learning a language, don't think about memorising as many words as possible; try to converse with a native speaker. If you are writing music, don't make a clever chord progression; instead, refer all your attempts at improvement back to whether it sounds good or not.

This is a great tool because it cuts through the abstractions that often surround the learning process. Especially for more cerebral people, complicated models can get in the way of actually learning. This doesn't preclude examining things more deeply; it does mean you must always keep the goal in sight.

It's corollary is another principle; Feedback. People acquire skills - especially motor skills - by performing an action and adjusting to stimuli. You could make an argument that most techniques employed in skill acquisition are just ways of adjusting attention to receive better feedback information. Your brain tunes a skill much, much faster when it is immediately given feedback.

Definitely recommend this book; very strongly reflected my memories of the most productive periods of learning in my life.

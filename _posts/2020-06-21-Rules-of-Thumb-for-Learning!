title: Rules of thumb for learning!
---
The skill of learning is endlessly interesting to me. I'm close to getting it, I swear - after lots of practice. Here are the more salient observations I've made.

One: You learn best when you immerse yourself totally in a subject. The more you can apply knowledge, the better you remember it. The more you connect it to things you already understand, the better you remember it. If you are able to really *inhabit* the world of the subject, that's really really good. 

Intuitive understanding comes from working with, playing with a subject, not just memorising it. And fresh perspectives come from taking that immersion in the subject and seeing how that subject's principles can apply to other things in your life. Every fresh stimulus becomes a new point of knowledge, and the underlying principles become clearer and clearer the more you see them across different circumstances.

Two: Feedback is king. You might have heard 'fail fast, fail often'. It's expressing basically the same idea. Volume of input yields volume of feedback, and your brain adapts to learning a new skill best when it's given good feedback that allow it to make immediate adjustments. Make sure your feedback is good, and find a way to get some if you're doing something where it's hard to tell how much you're progressing.

Three: Take the off route. If you have an urge to try doing it differently or to combine past experiences with what you're learning now, embrace it. I tend to think novelty has some intrinsic value: most of the skills I've been interested in learning have been artistic or required leaps of thinking, and I think people capable of bringing fresh perspective are more valuable than ever. You can't learn this from somebody else, it's something you have to learn to notice and cultivate - but it's often that secret sauce people get stuck trying to figure out.
